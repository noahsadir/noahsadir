## About Me

Hi there! 

I'm a first year computer science student at the University of Georgia.

You can view the source code of my personal projects here.

#### Languages:
- Java/Kotlin
- C#
- C++
- Swift
- Python
- PHP
- JavaScript (including React)
- HTML & CSS

#### Development Environments:
- Xcode
- Android Studio / Jetbrains
- Eclipse
- Visual Studio
- Unity3D
- Qt

I'm certainly open to collaboration and internship/job opportunites!
I have a particular interest in web and app development (and of course web app development), but I'm still very much interested in things beyond that.

### Inquiries
Feel free to reach me at development.noahsadir@gmail.com for any questions or requests.
